We're going to make an application where a use can visualize the cost benefits of investing vs paying off their student debt early.

It'll have two sets of text inputs, a section for investment details and a section for the loan details.

Loan detail inputs:
Loan amount
Interest %
Monthly Payment

Investment detail inputs:
Initial amount
Return %
Monthly Investment

I'd like three graphs:
Loan Graph

- Loan Amount
- Interest Amount

Investment Graph

- Amount Invested
- Amount Appreciated
- Total

Net Worth Graph

- Interest Owed
- Investment Appreciation
- Loan Amount - Total Invested

Graphs will be over 10 years, maybe adjustable

I would like the UI to look modern with a clean style.

I think we should use nivo for the charts

We will work on the implementations together but first let me know if you have any questions.
